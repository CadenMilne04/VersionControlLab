# Version Control Lab

________

## Description:

This project allows a user to input any string, and any number. Then it will print out that string that many times. Written in python 3.7. Troubleshooted using Jupyter. A feature to add could be the ability to save the output to a file on the computer.

## How to Run:

Just download the ***DoSomething.py*** file and run it using the python command.

## How to Use:

Follow the prompts, enter correct data types. 

## Why We Chose:

* **MIT LICENCE**- It was the most simple and permissive and our project is not very important to us at this moment.

* **Coraline Ada Ehmke's CoC**-It is the most popular code of conduct and it seemed like the best option for this application.
